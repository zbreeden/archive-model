# Archive Model

> **The Archive is the ledger**

## 🪐 Mercury of the Analytics Solar System

The Archive serves as **Mercury** in the FourTwenty Analytics constellation - the information messenger orbiting closest to The Barycenter (our Genesis source). Like Mercury in mythology, The Archive carries messages between all stars in the system, gathering intelligence and delivering reports across the constellation.

### 🌟 Astronomical Positioning
- **☀️ The Barycenter (Sun)**: Genesis source with unchanging templates and system definitions
- **🪐 The Archive (Mercury)**: Rapid pulse cycles, information nexus, constellation dashboard
- **🌍 Core System**: Foundation services orbiting at stable distances  
- **🪐 Delivery & Growth**: Specialized functions in extended orbital paths

The Archive sits in the perfect **information sweet spot** - close enough to The Barycenter to maintain system coherence, yet with independent orbital velocity to serve as the constellation's fastest-moving intelligence gatherer. It pulses through the entire system nightly, collecting status data and reporting back to the command center dashboard.

## 📡 Archive Activation

**The Archive has been activated!** 🫀✨

The Archive Model is now actively developing and serves as the constellation's memory keeper. It performs several key functions:

### 🔄 Constellation Pulse System
- **Nightly Status Monitoring**: The Archive pulses through all constellation stars each night
- **Status Synchronization**: Updates the canonical status registry with current star states
- **Automated Broadcasts**: Generates constellation-wide status reports via `signals/latest.json`
- **Backup & Safety**: Creates timestamped backups before any modifications

### 📊 Status Tracking
- Monitors all star lifecycle stages: `seed` → `sprout` → `developing` → `budding` → `bloom`
- Tracks constellation health and development progress
- Maintains canonical module registry in `seeds/modules.yml`

### 🛠️ Automation Scripts
- `scripts/pulse-constellation.sh`: Nightly constellation status pulse
- `scripts/validate.sh`: Module structure validation
- `scripts/AUTOMATION.md`: Setup and monitoring documentation

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Review seeds/**: Adapt seeded data for this module
2. **Configure schemas/**: Update schema definitions as needed  
3. **Generate signals/**: Create latest.json broadcast file
4. **Run validation**: `scripts/validate.sh`

## 📡 Broadcasting

This module produces a `signals/latest.json` file conforming to the constellation's broadcast schema. The Signal (📡) aggregates these across all stars.
