# Archive Model

> **The Archive is the ledger**

## 🪐 Mercury of the Analytics Solar System

The Archive serves as **Mercury** in the FourTwenty Analytics constellation - the information messenger orbiting closest to The Barycenter (our Genesis source). Like Mercury in mythology, The Archive carries messages between all stars in the system, gathering intelligence and delivering reports across the constellation.

### 🌟 Astronomical Positioning

- **☀️ The Barycenter (Sun)**: Genesis source with unchanging templates and system definitions
- **🪐 The Archive (Mercury)**: Rapid pulse cycles, information nexus, constellation dashboard
- **🌍 Core System**: Foundation services orbiting at stable distances  
- **🪐 Delivery & Growth**: Specialized functions in extended orbital paths

The Archive sits in the perfect **information sweet spot** - close enough to The Barycenter to maintain system coherence, yet with independent orbital velocity to serve as the constellation's fastest-moving intelligence gatherer. It pulses through the entire system in nightly cycles, collecting all means of data, cleaning it, normalizing it, automating it, and reporting back to the command center dashboard. It is such an expedient little data analyst.

## 🌌 Constellation Information

- **Module Key**: `archive_model`  
- **Repository**: `archive-model`
- **Orbit**: 🪐
- **Status**: 🚧
- **Emoji**: 🫀

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Review seeds/**: Adapt seeded data for this module
2. **Configure schemas/**: Update schema definitions as needed  
3. **Generate signals/**: Create latest.json broadcast file

## 📡 Broadcasting

This module produces a `signals/latest.json` file conforming to the constellation's broadcast schema. The Signal (📡) aggregates these across all stars.  Use new-broadcast.sh within /scripts to run a new broadast.

## 🔗 CORE SYSTEM Links

- **Hub**: [FourTwenty Analytics](https://github.com/zbreeden/FourTwentyAnalytics)
- **The Archive**: Glossary, tags, and canonical definitions pulled down nightly and distributed out for constellation harmony.
- **The Signal**: Cross-constellation broadcasting and telemetry pulled and circulated nightly to foster promotion and development.
- **The Launch**: Detailed workflows pulled in nightly to assure an aligned culture of process improvement that starts from the Barycenter outwards to foster healthy architecture.
- **The Protector**: Examines workflows to assure drift is minimal fostering sustainability.
- **The Develper**: Feeds the constellation data for healthy modelling.
