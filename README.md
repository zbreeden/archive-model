# Archive Model

> **The Archive is the ledger**

## 🪐 Mercury of the Analytics Solar System

The Archive serves as **Mercury** in the FourTwenty Analytics constellation - the information messenger orbiting closest to The Barycenter (our Genesis source). Like Mercury in mythology, The Archive carries messages between all stars in the system, gathering intelligence and delivering reports across the constellation.

### 🌟 Astronomical Positioning

- **☀️ The Barycenter (Sun)**: Genesis source with unchanging templates and system definitions
- **🪐 The Archive (Mercury)**: Rapid pulse cycles, information nexus, constellation dashboard
- **🌍 Core System**: Foundation services orbiting at stable distances  
- **🪐 Delivery & Growth**: Specialized functions in extended orbital paths

The Archive sits in the perfect **information sweet spot** - close enough to The Barycenter to maintain system coherence, yet with independent orbital velocity to serve as the constellation's fastest-moving intelligence gatherer. It pulses through the entire system in nightly cycles, collecting all means of data, cleaning it, normalizing it, automating it, and reporting back to the command center dashboard. It is such an expedient little data analyst.

## 📡 Archive Activation

**The Archive has been officially activated!** 🫀✨

The Archive Model is now actively developing and serves as the constellation's memory keeper. It performs several key functions:

### 🔄 Constellation Pulse System

- **Nightly Status Monitoring**: The Archive pulses through all constellation stars each night
- **Status Synchronization**: Updates the canonical status registry with current star states
- **Automated Broadcasts**: Generates constellation-wide status reports via `signals/latest.json`
- **Backup & Safety**: Creates timestamped backups before any modifications

### 📊 Status Tracking

- Monitors all star lifecycle stages: `seed` → `sprout` → `developing` → `budding` → `bloom` → `active`
- Tracks constellation health and development progress
- Maintains canonical module registry in `seeds/modules.yml`
- The Launch monitors the lifecycle

### 🛠️ Automation Scripts

- `scripts/pulse-constellation.sh`: Nightly constellation status pulse
- `scripts/validate.sh`: Module structure validation
- `scripts/AUTOMATION.md`: Setup and monitoring documentation

### 📜 Constellation Script Aggregation

The Archive Model serves as the **master of the scrolls** - the central repository for all constellation scripting knowledge. The script aggregation workflow systematically collects, deduplicates, and preserves scripts from across all FourTwenty Analytics stars.

#### Philosophy

> *"Breathes life into the constellation by maintaining memory, seeds, and history. Think master of the scrolls."*

The Archive ensures no scripting knowledge is ever lost by:

- 📜 **Collecting** all scripts from every constellation star  
- 🔄 **Deduplicating** content while preserving meaningful variants
- 💾 **Preserving** historical versions through timestamped backups
- 🛡️ **Protecting** against conflicts with intelligent merging

#### Key Features

- **🔍 Smart Discovery**: Automatically finds all `*-model/scripts/` directories
- **🔄 Duplicate Detection**: SHA-256 hashing identifies content redundancy
- **🔀 Conflict Resolution**: Creates merged versions when content differs
- **📍 Source Tracking**: Every collected script tagged with origin
- **💾 Safety Backups**: Timestamped preservation before any changes
- **🔄 Restoration Tools**: Complete backup management and recovery

#### Usage

```bash
# Manual aggregation (collect all constellation scripts)
./scripts/aggregate-scripts.sh

# Validate collection health and coverage
./scripts/validate-scripts.sh

# Manage backups and restoration
./scripts/restore-scripts.sh list
./scripts/restore-scripts.sh restore <timestamp>
./scripts/restore-scripts.sh clean
```

#### Four-Phase Process

1. **🔍 Discovery** - Scan constellation for script directories
2. **💾 Preservation** - Backup current archive state
3. **🔄 Deduplication** - Hash-based content comparison and merging  
4. **📦 Deployment** - Replace with deduplicated collection

#### Current Status

- **Complete Coverage**: 100% of active constellation stars aggregated
- **Comprehensive Collection**: Constellation scripts + native archive scripts
- **Intelligent Conflicts**: Merged versions created for content differences
- **Full Traceability**: Every file tagged with constellation source

**📖 Complete Documentation**: `scripts/README_SCRIPT_AGGREGATION.md` & `scripts/SCRIPT_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md`

### 🧹 Script Collection Optimization

After aggregating constellation scripts, The Archive provides intelligent scrubbing workflows to optimize storage while preserving all essential knowledge. The scrubbing system normalizes collected scripts without losing any functional content.

#### Master of Scrolls Maintenance Cycle

```bash
# 1. Aggregate constellation scripts (collect knowledge)
./scripts/aggregate-scripts.sh

# 2. Scrub and optimize collection (preserve efficiently)  
./scripts/scrub-scripts.sh

# 3. Monitor storage growth (track Archive health)
./scripts/monitor-size.sh
```

#### 🛡️ Safe Optimization Features

- **🔍 Pattern Analysis**: Identifies duplicate and similar scripts across constellation
- **🗑️ Duplicate Removal**: Safely removes exact duplicates while preserving provenance
- **📝 Header Standardization**: Normalizes metadata format for consistency
- **🧹 Whitespace Cleanup**: Removes formatting inconsistencies and trailing spaces
- **📊 Growth Monitoring**: Tracks Archive size trends and optimization effectiveness

#### Interactive Optimization Menu

1. **🗑️ Remove exact duplicates** (safe) - Eliminates byte-for-byte identical files
2. **📝 Standardize metadata headers** - Normalizes source attribution format  
3. **🧹 Clean whitespace and formatting** - Polishes code formatting consistency
4. **📊 Generate detailed analysis report** - Produces optimization recommendations
5. **💾 Create optimization backup** - Additional safety layer before changes
6. **❌ Exit without changes** - Safe exit option

#### Size Optimization Results

The scrubbing workflow achieves immediate storage savings:

- **Header Standardization**: Files normalized to consistent format
- **Whitespace Cleanup**: Files optimized for clean formatting  
- **Measurable Savings**: Typical 5-10% storage reduction
- **Zero Data Loss**: All functional content and provenance preserved

#### 🕒 Recommended Usage Pattern

**Manual Optimization Cycle** - Run scrubbing after each script pulse aggregation:

- Constellation grows at human speed (no automation needed)
- Manual oversight ensures thoughtful optimization decisions
- Safety systems enable confident experimentation
- Growth monitoring tracks long-term Archive health

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Review seeds/**: Adapt seeded data for this module
2. **Configure schemas/**: Update schema definitions as needed  
3. **Generate signals/**: Create latest.json broadcast file
4. **Run validation**: `scripts/validate.sh`

## 📡 Broadcasting

This module produces a `signals/latest.json` file conforming to the constellation's broadcast schema. The Signal (📡) aggregates these across all stars.
